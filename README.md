## Introduction

Customer churn refers to the loss of customers over time. This project leverages machine learning models to predict potential churners based on historical data. Additionally, Power BI dashboards are created to visualize churn metrics and aid in decision-making.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

Data
The dataset used for this project should include historical customer data, including features such as transaction history, customer demographics, and customer interactions. Ensure that the dataset is well-organized and does not contain missing values.

##Preprocessing
Preprocess the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features. This step ensures the data is suitable for training machine learning models.

##Machine Learning Models
Train and evaluate machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests, to predict customer churn. Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

##Power BI Dashboards
Connect Power BI to your dataset.
Create visuals for key churn metrics, such as churn rate, customer lifetime value, and customer satisfaction.
Utilize Power BI's interactive features to allow users to explore and analyze the data.
Implement a real-time dashboard for monitoring current churn status.
Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive solution for predicting customer churn and implementing retention strategies. The combination of machine learning models and Power BI dashboards empowers businesses to make informed decisions and improve customer retention.
